.. dropdown:: What is a Dataset?
    :color: primary
    :icon: question

    A **Dataset** is a versioned collection of files and directories managed by OSMO.

    Key benefits:

    - 📦 **Automatic deduplication** - identical files are stored only once across versions
    - 🔄 **Full version history** - track and rollback changes over time
    - 🎯 **Any file type** - no restrictions on what you can store
    - ☁️ **Multi-cloud support** - works with S3, GCS, Azure, and more

    See :ref:`concepts_ds` for complete details.
