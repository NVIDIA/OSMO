================
Using the Web UI
================

The easiest way to get started with submitting workflows to OSMO is to use the Web UI.
A workflow is essentially a job that will be executed in the compute cluster.
This section will walk you through using the Web UI to
submit your first workflow to OSMO and to track its progress as it runs.

.. note::

  The recommended web browsers are Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
