This should align with the "Non-Goals" field from the project proposal.

- Non-goal 1: ...
- Non-goal 2: ...
- Non-goal 3: ...

## Project Design (Overview)

_Provide a high-level technical overview of the proposed solution. How will we solve the problem? What is the general approach?_

This should expand on the "High-Level Approach" field from the project proposal. Include:

- Architecture overview
- Key components or modules
- How they fit together
- User-facing changes (if applicable)

## Detailed Design

_Provide the detailed technical design. This is the core of the document._

Include:

- API designs (new endpoints, function signatures, interfaces)
- Data models and schemas
- System architecture diagrams
- Component interactions and workflows
- Configuration changes
- User interface mockups or flows (if applicable)
- Examples of how the system will be used

Break this into subsections as needed for clarity.

## Alternatives Considered

_What other approaches did you consider? Why did you choose this design over the alternatives?_

For each alternative:

- Describe the approach
- List pros and cons
- Explain why it was not chosen

## Impact
